This was a school project I started in order to make a simple multiplayer game without using any external libraries for my Computer Science A-Level project. I ended up not finishing the game part of my project due to the fact there was limited time and I wanted to focus on my subjects rather than a feature-rich game. However, I did decide to create a piece of software to edit maps for my ray-casting environment which turned out quite nice.

Perhaps you should see it for yourself!

Here is a quick run-through of the code and the critical path with a few explanations behind certain optimisations and choices.

(might be a little quiet, I recorded this on an old school computer in 2019)

The code will not be published until the project is marked and secured under my name
